  Vision Clarity Questions:

  1. What does "modular versatility" mean to you specifically?
    - Are you thinking plug-and-play components that snap together?



    - Configurable sections that can be enabled/disabled?

        Yes. I have conceptualized a plugin system where you can drag and drop components on the table sections and cells, modifying their behavior and output.

    - Something else entirely?

        Your intuition is basically correct. Just with specifc use cases.

  2. What are the core "table parts" you envision?
    - What should be the fundamental building blocks?

            The A-B sections mentioned above as a product specific table. This table will have a duplicate table structure that can be nested within it as a C-D table. the combined table can expand and collapse pieces of itself, each have toolbars above their headers to control this behavior. The toolbars will also accept a 'toolbar plugin' that allows user to apply drag and drop 'insert plugins' and send plugins'. 

    - How granular should the modularity be?

        extremely. But I want to start simple with a functional AB CD nested table system where its parts can be easily assigned functions with a simple and efficient logic structure. My thought (and this is where the overengineering risk becomes a danger) is that my vision can be achieved by devising a scalable component architecture that does not rely on giant code base files to minimize abstracttion, or extraneously modular files that lead to an excess of abstraction and confusion when things break (the current issue I keep running into when trying to build refined systems from the good parts of over-abstracted systems)

  3. What analysis use cases do you need to support?

    All the common key performance indicators, as well as statistics-based computations to develop and validate nuanced sales performance trends between products. 

    The modular flexibility of the table system will allow users to explore trends, compare product performance, and discover hidden patterns in interproduct correlations with relative ease using plug and play, drag and drop components. The use case for this is that a store manager or sales associate can identify actionable insights quickly on a mobile divice without needing to rely on clunky analytics platforms that are limited in scope yet standard in retail analytics. If a user wants to see how inventory blackouts affect performance beyond surface level losses, 


  4. What from Table.jsx works well vs what's problematic?
    - What features do you want to preserve?
    - What makes it brittle or hard to extend?

            Originally, Table.jsx file was the building block for current system I envision. The A1 A2 A3 B1 B2 B3 sections have a specific 'scroll sync' behavior that is beautiful BUT BRITTLE. When things break, it is always due to careless edits to sections that ignore how the scroll sync behavior interacts with each section in the system. That being said, this brittleness is not a basis to abandon the scroll sync behavior. But there needs to be a clear set of rules for maintaining the table structure and behavior, or perhaps a programming solution to strengthen it. Being able to model plug and play components that do not break its mechanics is currently a huge challenge.

  5. How do you envision feeding data to the table?
    - Should templates transform data before it reaches the table?
    - Should the table adapt to whatever data structure it receives?

        they can assemble an AB table in a table workspace. drop a toolbar plugin on that empty table's toolbar, throw a metric insert on it. Then the use could drop a top performers plugin into the A1 section, metric header plugins into the B1 space. A2 and B2 populate with the products and respective values, A3 and B3 generate totals and summary values. Each A2 product row is now a CD toolbar displaying the product name with C sections nested in A2 and D sections nested in B2. So C1 can represent a product variant type, C2 are rows for each variant, C3 is variant summary. D1 is variant specific metric headers, D2 are the respective variant values, D3 is totals. The user can collapse and expand the CD nested table with the CD toolbar. CD product toolbar can also have toolbar plugins dropped on them. these toolbars can have plugin inserts and plugin sends. the system would have a signal path configured through toolbars to aggregate pieces of the nested system, as well as send pieces of the system to new tables that can hold the state of nested tables if needed, and apply additional analysis plugins for complex aggregation without cluttering one workspace (the whole AB CD table system can collapse into a toolbar and that toolbar can be dropped into a new table, or toolbars within a signal path can be dropped into a new table while holding state from the signal path up to them). This system can take top 20 performers by units and net, compare baseline KPIs in AB table, compare variants within a style, aggregate AB product rows in CD tables, have CD tables render products with top attach rates to each product, send remote plugin configured metric data within a drag and drop product toolbar, along with its variants, top attach rate performers, and any other complex nested comparative features to endless tables with endless configurations (within reason). Users can save table states, save templates, etc.

    - Where should business logic live?

        The toolbar plugins

  6. What does "beautifully simple" look like to you?
    - Simple to use? Simple to extend? Simple to maintain?

        simple to use, simple to extend. It sounds like an incredibly challenging system to maintain, hence the planning.

    - What would make you excited to build new tables?

    the endless potential to discover an actionable analytics insight to help boost sales metrics in my store
